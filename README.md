# gslides-no-scroll-tm

Tampermonkey userscript to stop Google Slides from advancing between slides when accidentally scrolling with the mouse (esp. with an Apple Magic Mouse). Works both in editing mode and in presentation mode. 

## Installation

You have to use Chrome or Chrome-like browser with the Tampermonkey extension installed.

Click on the Tampermonkey icon, click Dashboard, click the Tab Utilities and paste the URL
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mieckert/gslides-no-scroll-tm/main/gslides-no-scroll.js
```
into Import from URL textbox.  On the next page click "Install" or "Reinstall".

## Thanks

This user script was inspired by the [stop-slide-scrolling](https://github.com/sneakaway-studio/stop-slide-scrolling) Chrome plugin, which
however blocked scrolling for me only in editing mode, but not in presentation mode.
